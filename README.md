        My software adventure started when I wondered how games are made instead of playing games, years after I met the first computer in February 2009. “Security” and “Hosting” along with this acquaintance, for some reasons that caught my attention, my field of interest completely turned to these areas. If I remember correctly, this meeting happened in 2015 and I am improving myself every day in these 2 fields with a new goal of knowledge. While focusing on linux local security systems in this interval, I started to focus on WAF/FIREWALL systems due to the http flood attacks and my Layer7 Firewall project, which we serve you today, started to form. When I met the R10.Net, the development process started to turn into the marketing process. I am currently working as a security manager in a few private companies.</br> Nice to meet you (:
